  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own customers" ON customers
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own customers" ON customers
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

      AND customers.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
